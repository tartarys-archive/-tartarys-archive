Ledger Entry 0013
Title: Blockchain Network Selection Confirmed

Date: 2026.01.09.
Repository: corvina-ledger

Description:
The Corvina Keepers project has finalized its initial blockchain network selection.

The BNB Smart Chain (mainnet) has been chosen as the execution environment
for the first Corvina Sigil Jeton (CSJ) smart contract.

Rationale:
- Low and predictable transaction fees suitable for ceremonial minting
- Mature tooling (MetaMask, Remix, BscScan)
- Fast block times enabling real-time public witnessing
- Sufficient decentralization for the project’s initial scope
- Clear separation between testnet experimentation and mainnet demonstration

Principles:
- All demonstration minting will occur on mainnet to ensure real economic finality
- Testnets may be used privately for development, but are not considered part of the Ledger
- No dependency on centralized platforms for validation or record-keeping

Scope:
This selection applies exclusively to:
- Corvina Sigil Jeton v1
- First minting demonstration
- Treasury custody and initial allocations

Future Considerations:
Multi-chain deployment, bridges, or alternative networks
may be evaluated in later phases (v2+),
subject to community review and governance.

Status:
Confirmed.
