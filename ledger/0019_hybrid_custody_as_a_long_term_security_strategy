# 0019 – Hybrid Custody as a Long-Term Security Strategy
2026.01.12.

## Context

As part of the Corvina Keepers initiative, questions have emerged regarding the long-term resilience of purely digital cryptographic systems, particularly in light of ongoing research into quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography.

While no immediate threat exists to contemporary blockchain security, responsible stewardship requires acknowledging long-horizon technological risks and designing systems that remain robust across generations.

## Observation

Purely digital custody models rely exclusively on mathematical hardness assumptions.
These assumptions have historically evolved over time and may continue to do so.

In contrast, systems that combine:
- cryptographic guarantees,
- physical custody,
- documented provenance,
- human witnessing,
- and immutable public ledgers,

do not depend on a single failure domain.

## Principle

Corvina Keepers deliberately adopts a **hybrid custody model**, where value and legitimacy are anchored simultaneously in:

1. **On-chain cryptographic records**
2. **Physical artifacts held in audited custody**
3. **Off-chain documentation and signed declarations**
4. **Public, append-only ledger entries**
5. **Ceremonial minting with human witnesses**

This layered structure ensures that no single technological breakthrough — including advances in computation — can invalidate the system as a whole.

## Rationale

Even in a hypothetical future where cryptographic primitives require migration or strengthening:
- physical custody remains verifiable,
- provenance remains traceable,
- ledger history remains intact,
- and community witnessing preserves legitimacy.

The system is therefore **adaptable rather than fragile**.

## Position

Corvina Keepers does not claim immunity from technological change.
Instead, it acknowledges change as inevitable and designs accordingly.

The hybrid model is not a reaction to fear, but an expression of foresight.

## Statement

Long-term value preservation is best served not by maximal abstraction,
but by **anchoring digital systems in reality**.

This ledger entry records the conscious adoption of a hybrid custody philosophy
as a foundational design choice of Corvina Keepers.
