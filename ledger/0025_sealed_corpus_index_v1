# 0025 – Sealed Corpus Index (v1)
2026.01.20.
## Timestamp
Recorded immediately following the sealing of all Corvina Keepers v1 foundational documents.

## Purpose
This entry serves as the authoritative index of all documents
that constitute the **sealed v1 corpus** of the Corvina Keepers system.

It provides a single reference point for verification, audit,
historical continuity, and future governance.

No new definitions are introduced here.
This is a structural closure and anchoring event.

## Sealed Documents Overview

### 1. Corvina Keepers White Paper v1
Role:
- Foundational intent
- Purpose, scope, and ethical framing

---

## Corpus Integrity
Each document listed above exists simultaneously in:
- A signed physical original
- A scanned digital representation
- A cryptographic SHA-256 hash recorded in the ledger

Together, these elements establish:
- Proof of authorship
- Proof of existence
- Temporal anchoring
- Tamper-evident continuity

No document in the v1 corpus may be altered, replaced,
or silently superseded.

Any future modification requires:
- Explicit versioning (v2, v3, …)
- New sealing entries
- Clear differentiation from v1

## Governance Implications
The sealed v1 corpus represents:
- The Founder’s binding proposal to the community
- The initial trust surface of the Corvina Keepers system
- The reference layer against which all future actions are evaluated

Authority now transitions from *authoring* to *stewardship*.

## Operational Boundary
With this index recorded:
- The conceptual phase is formally closed
- The system is eligible to enter operational execution
- Minting, custody, and witnessing actions may proceed
  strictly within the boundaries defined by the v1 corpus

## Forward Compatibility
This index does not restrict evolution.
It ensures that evolution remains:
- Traceable
- Auditable
- Ethically coherent

What follows must grow **from** this corpus,
not overwrite it.

## Closing Statement
The Corvina Keepers v1 corpus is now whole.

Nothing essential is missing.
Nothing essential can be removed without trace.

From here forward, history is written by actions,
not by rewritten words.

Only Honor.
