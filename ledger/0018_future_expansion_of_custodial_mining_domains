# 0018 – Future Expansion of Custodial Mining Domains

2026.01.11.

## Context
Following external review and early community feedback on Corvina Keepers v1 documents,
a recurring question emerged regarding the potential expansion of custodial banknote mining
to countries beyond Hungary.

This entry formally records the founding response and design position.

## Foundational Position
Corvina Keepers v1 intentionally limits custodial mining to Hungarian banknotes
(Pengő-era artifacts) in order to:

- demonstrate the custodial mining model in a controlled, auditable environment,
- establish a clear ceremonial, archival, and ledger-based precedent,
- avoid premature complexity and jurisdictional ambiguity.

This limitation is **by design**, not by constraint.

## Framework-Level Insight
The Corvina Keepers framework is **country-agnostic at the protocol level**.

What is localized in v1:
- the physical artifacts (Hungarian banknotes),
- the historical and cultural context,
- the initial custodial demonstration.

What is universal:
- archival custody principles,
- digital witnessing and hashing,
- NFT-based attestations,
- minting logic,
- ledger immutability,
- ethical and custodial governance.

## V2 Expansion Principle (Recorded Intent)
In Corvina Keepers v2, expansion to additional countries is considered viable through
**Custodial Domains**, defined as:

- country-specific archival and custodial scopes,
- governed locally by qualified custodians and witnesses,
- anchored to the same Corvina Keepers standards and ledger principles.

Each new domain would require:
- explicit custodial declaration,
- adherence to Corvina Sigil minting standards,
- expert validation where applicable (e.g., numismatics),
- transparent ledger inclusion as a distinct branch.

## Governance Note
Expansion is envisioned as **invite-based and custodially governed**, not open-ended.
This preserves integrity, avoids dilution, and aligns with the role of Corvina Keepers
as stewards rather than extractive operators.

## Status
This entry records intent and architectural foresight only.

No expansion beyond Hungarian banknotes is active in v1.
All such extensions are deferred to v2 and beyond, subject to custodial governance.

## Ledger Effect
- No on-chain action.
- No minting action.
- No parameter change.

This entry serves as an immutable clarification and forward-looking anchor.

Recorded with intent,
Corvina Keepers Ledger
