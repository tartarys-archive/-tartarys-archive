# 0024 – CST Standard v1 Sealing & Custodial Registration
2026.01.20.
## Timestamp
Recorded upon cryptographic verification of the signed CST Standard v1 document.

## Context
The CST (Cultural Signature Token) Standard defines the conceptual,
structural, and ethical rules governing signature-based cultural
and symbolic minting within the Corvina Keepers ecosystem.

Its role is foundational: it establishes how meaning, provenance,
and non-fungible cultural intent are preserved without collapsing
into speculative abstraction.

With this sealing, the CST Standard exits draft and interpretive phase
and enters immutable custodial reference.

## Document Sealed
- CST Standard v1 (signed original, scanned PDF)

## Cryptographic Proof
CST Standard v1  
SHA-256 hash:

b0d8a5e577ebd00defda4e2bc0d192fe40e4baa1017d0fd79c178e9d99b4d75d

This hash uniquely identifies the exact document state at the moment of sealing.

## Custodial Status
The CST Standard v1 is hereby placed under **Corvina Keepers Custodianship**.

Custodianship implies:
- Preservation of the signed physical original
- Immutable digital reference via cryptographic hash
- Explicit version separation between v1 and any future revisions
- Protection against silent reinterpretation or scope drift

The CST Standard v1 is binding as a **definition layer**, not as a coercive rulebook.

## Relationship to Other Sealed Artifacts
With this entry, the following foundational documents are now sealed
and jointly form the Corvina Keepers v1 corpus:

- Corvina Keepers White Paper v1
- Corvina Sigil Standard v1
- Y-B Protocol v1
- CST Standard v1

Together, these documents define:
- Purpose (WP)
- Value-signature mechanics (Sigil)
- Ethical witnessing & governance (Y-B)
- Cultural meaning preservation (CST)

## Disclosure Policy
Public distribution of the CST Standard v1 may occur at any time,
provided that the distributed file matches the recorded hash.

The ledger entry itself establishes proof of existence, authorship,
and temporal anchoring.

## Status
Sealing completed.  
CST Standard v1 enters custodial phase.

## Closing Statement
With the CST Standard sealed, the Corvina Keepers system now rests on
a closed and verifiable v1 foundation.

From this point forward:
- Evolution is explicit
- Changes are additive, not retroactive
- Meaning cannot be diluted without trace

What is sealed is not frozen —  
but it can no longer be quietly rewritten.

Only Honor.
