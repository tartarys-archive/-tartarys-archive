# tartarys-archive
This account exists to preserve ideas, texts, and standards
that are placed under community witnessing rather than authority.

No ownership is claimed here.
No enforcement is exercised.
Only authorship, intent, and chronology are recorded.

What matters is not who controls these ideas,
but that they cannot be silently erased or rewritten.

# What is preserved here
- Foundational whitepapers and standards (v1, v2…)
- Community-governed models and protocols
- Cultural and intellectual artifacts placed under guardianship
- Public records of intent, authorship, and release chronology

This archive does not host products.
It hosts origins.


# What this is not
- Not a company
- Not a DAO
- Not a legal authority
- Not a marketplace
- Not a promise of profit or utility

Nothing here asks for trust.
Everything here invites scrutiny.


# How this archive is used
Documents published here may be:
- referenced publicly
- forked or mirrored
- cited as prior art or public disclosure
- discussed, criticized, or ignored

They may not be silently altered in place.
History remains readable.


# Status

This archive is intentionally minimal.
Development happens elsewhere.
Decisions emerge through community process.

Silence here does not mean inactivity.
It means restraint.
